# SolarSail / "a class based FPS"
### A framework for making RPG games, and also other games.

## Hol Up:
This isn't probably the repo you're looking for.

Seriously, this just contains a game for the SolarSail engine; with some inherent modifications to support it better.

## Controls:

`W` Walk fowards.

`S` Walk backwards.

`A` Sidestep left.

`D` Sidestep right.

`1..9 or Mouse Wheel` Select weapon from active list.

`E` Reload active weapon, or change active tool mode.

`Shift` Walking, so you can't fall off cliffs.

`Shift + Right Mouse` Throw the flag or objective item.

`Left Mouse` Shoot weapon, or melee, or place blocks.

`Right Mouse` Aims weapon, sometimes zooms in should it have magnification.

`Space` Jump. You surely knew this, right?


## How to Play:
A dev server, coming soooooon.
